Stopwatch Web Application
A stopwatch web application is a simple yet powerful tool that allows users to measure the amount of time that elapses between its activation and deactivation. This application is built using HTML for the structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality. Users can start, stop, and reset the timer with intuitive controls.
